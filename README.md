## Overview  
[ML-Final-Web](https://github.com/Naijei1/ML-Final-Web) is a final project for INFO-1998, developed to demonstrate the integration of machine learning models into a web application. The project utilizes a dataset containing various health metrics to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.  

**Live Demo:** [https://info1998-final.streamlit.app/](https://info1998-final.streamlit.app/)
